# MITlib Analytics

This Wordpress plugin provides a very thin implementation of Google Analytics
which supports cross-domain implementation with other GA properties. For
example, the Libraries' public-facing web presence spans both libraries.mit.edu
and libguides.mit.edu - having this plugin in place allows us to understand web
traffic across both domains as a single entity.
