This is a Wordpress plugin that builds a widget for the administrative interface. It lists all content from the current theme that has a certain flag set.

The theme is used on the MIT Libraries' news site (http://libraries.mit.edu/news) to identify for site administrators which articles have been promoted to the Libraries' front page.
