# MITlib Post Exhibits

This defines an Exhibit custom post type, extending the Base class provided by
Mitlib Post. The content type was defined initially using the [Custom Post Type UI](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-ui/)
plugin, and a set of custom fields was created using [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/).

The fields within this post type are defined in a JSON file that can be found in
the Mitlib Post data folder.
