# MITlib Post Experts

This defines an Expert custom post type, extending the Base class provided by
Mitlib Post. The content type was defined initially using the [Custom Post Type UI](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-ui/)
plugin, and a set of custom fields was created using [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/).

The Expert post type is also added to the set of content which the WordPress API
publishes, in order for it to appear on the site homepage.

The fields within this post type are defined in a JSON file that can be found in
the Mitlib Post data folder.
