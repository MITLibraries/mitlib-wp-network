# MITlib Post Interviewees

This defines an Interviewee custom post type, extending the Base class provided
by Mitlib Post. The original content type was defined via CPT-onomies, with the
fields defined using Toolset Types. This setup was then migrated to Mitlib Post
and ACF in 2023.

The Interviewee post type is referenced by the Interview post type, and also
includes a few controlled vocabularies to group Interviewee records.

The fields for this post type are defined in a JSON file that can be found in
the Mitlib Post data folder.
