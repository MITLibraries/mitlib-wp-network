# MITlib Post Interviews

This defines an Interview custom post type, extending the Base class provided by
Mitlib Post. The content type was defined initially using the CPT-onomies
plugin, with the fields created using Toolset Types. This setup was subsequently
migrated to Mitlib Post and ACF in 2023.

The Interview post type includes a relationship to the Interviewee post type.

The fields for this post type are defined in a JSON file that can be found in
the Mitlib Post data folder.
